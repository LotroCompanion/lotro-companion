The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lore of the Blade seems to be a rather unusual tome for a Lore-master to express interest in. Rather than delving deeply into the hidden mysteries of mountains, or discussing at length the habits of wave and wind, it reads more like a rousing tale of adventure written to entertain hobbit-children. The pages of Lore of the Blade claim to follow the adventures of a brave young Lore-master who when confronted with deadly dangers is just as apt to fight her way through with flashing swordplay as to confound her opponents with the lore of the elements or the wisdom of long forgotten sages. Oddly, as you find yourself drawn into the stirring tale you begin to see the more subtle nuances of the story unfold through the eyes of its character, who displays an uncanny insight into the nature of the foes she faces, and an understanding of when the strength of arms applied at the correct moment may indeed be the least destructive course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, some prior reader has handled this copy rather poorly and some of the pages are torn beyond repair. The author also proves to be a bit difficult to pin down, as he has chosen to identify himself solely by the runic letter 'G' inscribed on the binding." objectives="Collect Lore of the Blade&#13;&#10;Talk to Gandalf in Rivendell&#13;&#10;Collect Lore of the Blade, Page 5&#13;&#10;Collect Lore of the Blade, Page 11&#13;&#10;Collect Lore of the Blade, Page 18&#13;&#10;Collect Lore of the Blade, Page 26&#13;&#10;Collect Lore of the Blade, Page 35&#13;&#10;Collect Lore of the Blade, Page 45&#13;&#10;Collect Lore of the Blade, Page 56&#13;&#10;Collect Lore of the Blade, Page 68">

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is unclear who wrote this book as no author's name is given, but the clarity and wisdom with which it is written only adds further to the mystery of its apparently modest writer. The Book of Beasts speaks at great length of the bonds which may be formed between creatures of the wilds and those among the Free Peoples of Middle-earth who are willing to understand their own true natures. It further claims that the Wise might even learn the tongues of the wild creatures of the world and may coax them to greater feats of bravery and strength than would otherwise be possible for a beast lacking in its own will to strive and accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whomever transcribed this particular copy, alas, does not appear to have been entirely in his right mind. Most of the text is clear, but some few of the pages are written in a hopeless scrawl with no meaning in any language of Elves or Men that you can discern. Indeed, it seems as if the scribe must have been taken with fits of madness during these passages.

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a strange book indeed. The covers are crafted from strips of some fibrous bark supple enough to be woven together, while the pages themselves appear to be birch bark pounded carefully flat and gently inscribed with runic letters in dense rows, page after page. What magic can have allowed such a fragile-looking tome to survive time and age, you cannot guess. Nor have you ever seen a book of such length, for its author goes into each subject and sentence with such painstaking detail that you cannot imagine how long it must have taken to record it all in this fashion. The subject appears to be anything with roots and leaves. There is such an enormous breadth of knowledge concerning root, leaf, bark, and twig that you could likely study it for years without understanding it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To your ire, someone or something has carefully removed a few of the pages from the volume, leaving you to wonder what hidden lore they must have contained.

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is said in the most ancient of tales that the world was formed in a great chorus of song, but this story is ancient and shrouded in myth even to the oldest among the living Elves, and no one in Middle-earth today could claim to know the truth of it. Towards the end of the Second Age, during the War of the Last Alliance, there was born a fair woman who sang in such wonderous tones that even the Elves would stop and listen in silence for so long as she would sing for them. Stranger still, she had no teaching in song or music, and yet could compose such melodies as to bring tears to the powerful and the Wise. She claimed that she composed no songs, and that she was simply trying to duplicate a music that she could hear -- a music that she claimed arose from the world itself, from mountains, streams, wind, and tree alike, in infinite variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melodies of the Valar is the book that contains these songs as the Elves transcribed them, but most of the copies of this book have been taken away into the West, and very few remain in Middle-earth today.

Drawing on the tradition of each of these peoples, the songs resound with a clarion call of freedom and hope that is unsullied by the slightest trace of sorrow, fear, or hate. There are some who claim that this work is shallow and without dimension, but to the adept minstrel, it is a description of form unparalleled by other works. Unfortunately, the book and its strident forms became 'unfashionable' after the fall of the North Kingdom, as a deep lethargy and cynicism crept over the kingdoms of Men, and the Elves withdrew ever further into their forest strongholds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Nowadays, The Rising Chord is quite difficult to find, and even when a copy is found -- such as this -- it is incomplete at best.

Though its cover crumbles with age, the binding remains strong, as if infused with the same martial fervour that the melodies within it strive to invoke. This book is one of the rare few that survived the fall of the kingdom of Númenor, coming across the waves by some unlikely circumstance to Middle-earth, where it has lain hidden for ages. Though written in the Sindarin tongue, the songs are those of the noble kingdoms of Men. Nevertheless, they speak to the heart of any who would face battle, calling forth visions of endless, shining hosts on the march, thundering with the clash of steel in a thousand voices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the hands of a minstrel, these songs of martial eminence provide crucial insight into the working of the warrior's heart and how it might be aroused from its slumber in times of need.

You cannot recognize the type of parchment it was written upon, nor what kind of ink could withstand the passage of so much time without fading. The main indication of its age and origin is the writing style which is in an extremely old form using ancient letters called Tengwar, which were created by the Noldor many ages ago. The main focus of the book is difficult to translate, but seems to centre around an ancient oath of battle that Elf-guardians might make in the midst of a desperate melee, in essence binding themselves and their enemies in a pact of battle and death that neither the oath-taker nor their sworn-enemies dared break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is clear from the text that these oaths carried power beyond that of any simple cry to infuriate or trick one's enemies -- but the secret of the technique seems lost as several key pages have been carefully cut from the book, presumably by someone hoping to safeguard its secrets in an age long past.

He hailed from Rhudaur not long before its fall in the war between Arnor and the forces of the Witch-king. Its pages discuss the powers of the class no Man has ever been able to follow, much less master. The writing is mad, scribbled in wild, uneven runes in a disorganized manner upon stained pages, many of which are loose leaves simply stuffed into the book. The writer was driven to madness by seeking the secrets of Rune-craft, but rumour has it that great and terrible discoveries were recorded in this text. The book's spine is cracked and weak, and only the first half of its pages cling, yellowed and fragile, to this withered binding.

This tome is an account told by a scribe of those brave Elf-warriors during the long wars against Morgoth. Much of it is a heroic epic, told in linnod-verse, describing multiple forays from the great city into the realms of the Enemy.
