# LOTRO Companion
A companion for LOTRO players.

This is a desktop application for LOTRO players. It will help in many ways, but its main features are:
- track status of your characters
- simulate gear on your characters
- browse databases of game data (recipes, titles, emotes, deeds...)

Character data can be synchronized with the local LOTRO Client (Windows only).
